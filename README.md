## Overview and Origin
	
* What is the name of the company?
	
The name of the company is Apple
* When was the company incorporated?
	
Apple was incorporated on January 3rd in the year 1977. Apple Pay was introduced on October 20th, 2014

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
	
Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak got the idea to start Apple from their desire to make computers small enough for people to use in their homes. The idea of Apple Pay came when the tech company wanted an alternative to physical debit and credit cards.

Apple was able to get initial funding from Jobs selling his Volkswagen bus and Wozniak selling his scientific calculator. The company was also able to get a $600,000 venture fund from a man named Mike Markkula. The Apple Pay project was funded by the company Apple itself.

## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
	
Apple started the project Apple Pay for their customers to use an electronic card on their phones to make purchases online, and in-store purchases, send money to others and pay for subscriptions without the need to have a physical credit or debit card at the time.  
* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
	
The company's intended customers are people who use Apple products such as the iPhone, iPad, and MacBook computers. There are estimated to be over a billion Apple consumers worldwide as of 2023 and there are no indications of the number decreasing.
* What solution does this company offer that its competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

What sets Apple Pay apart from its competitors is the type of security it ensures its consumers. The type of security is called tokenization. This method allows for a one-time code to be used to authorize the transaction.
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)
	
There are multiple technologies used by Apple to run Apple Pay efficiently. One kind of technology is called Near Field Communication(NFC) and it allows a person to make a contactless payment in stores by holding their phone next to the payment terminal. Another form of technology that is used by Apple is Face or Touch ID, this allows the Apple devices to authenticate that it is you before making the purchase aiding in a more secure transaction. Apple uses a REST API called Merchant Token Management API and it is used when a person starts the Apple Pay processes. Once the person starts a purchase with Apple Pay, Apple assigns a secure code for one-time use and authorizes the transaction. Apple also uses a Payment Request API which allows you to handle recurring payments, installments, and automatic card balance reloads.

## Landscape

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
	
The domain of the financial industry that Apple Pay falls under is payments and billing.
* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5 to 10 years?

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
	
Other than Apple, some of the major companies that reside under the domain of payments and billing are PayPal, Stripe, and Google Pay.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
	
Apple Pay has impacted the financial market by helping further perpetuate the use of mobile/contactless payments across the world. The use of Apple Pay has also been shown to help online markets by lowering the rate of abandoned carts due to its simplistic approach to online purchasing. 
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
	
In this domain to measure success, companies use a system known as AARRR with each letter standing for something else. The first A stands for acquisition metrics and it measures things such as app downloads and new user creation rate. The second A stands for activation metrics which help indicate how many active users the company has over a specified period. The first R stands for Retention metrics, this helps show how well the product retains its users’ attention and wants to keep using said product. The second R is for Referrals, and this refers to the number of consumers who recommend the company or product to other people. The final R is for revenue, which is how much money the company or product makes over any specified period. Based on these metrics Apple Pay is performing well with a 10% annual user increase, an estimated global user rate of 500+ million people, and a statistical prediction that 23% of all Americans will use Apple Pay by 2026
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
	
Compared to its competitors Apple Pay is one of the most used digital payment brands. With more users than Google and Samsung Pay, and near the same worldwide awareness rate as PayPay, Apple Pay has the potential to become the number one product in the digital payment world.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
	
f I were to advise the company Apple on how they could improve their product Apple Pay, I would tell them to allow Apple users to be able to send money to Android devices.
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
	
Offering this service would benefit the company because it could act as a bridge to their opposing demographic 
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
	To do this Apple must incorporate some kind of pin technology instead of just the face/touch ID technology
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
	
This technology is needed because it would allow Android products to be Apple to use Apple Pay without the need for facial ID. This will make it so Apple Pay is no longer limited to only Apple products with facial/touch recognition technology while still keeping the consumers’ accounts secure.
